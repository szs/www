          <p>Paradoxes have captivated humanity and its philosophy since ancient times. Our manifold explorations of them have seen philosophers, mathematicians, physicists, writers, and visual artists alike making it their center of interest. In fascination, we seek to understand its patterns and principles. Yet, by its nature, it eludes our minds’ grasp and fends off our constructs and systematization. As a result, paradoxes often act as the gatekeepers of new paradigms in science as in art, triggering new methods of seeing and understanding our world.</p>

          <p>ALMOST EXACTLY is a pictorial paradox compendium by Thoka Maer in three chapters, beginning with “Infinity”, followed by “Vagueness”, and departing at “Self-Reference”. These pencil illustrations traverse but a fraction of the vast surface of an infinite universe of paradoxes, with accompanying text that guides the beholder through the respective paradoxes. As one will see, these are drawings that explore paradoxicality with surreal, yet cordial imagery. </p>

              <h4>Chapter 1. Infinity</h4>
              <p>Though we exist in an infinite continuum of time and space, human existence is characterized by limitation. Evolution bore human life, and one day humanity will come to an end. Each is born and each will die. The “Now” is the end of an infinite past and the beginning of an infinite future. With minutes, hours, meters and miles, we mark segments to cope with the ungraspable. And with mathematics and physics, we can describe infinity. But the paradox remains: the limited human mind is and probably will always be incapable of perceiving infinity. We persist within the ambit of ‘apeiron’.</p>

              <h4>Zeno's Paradoxes</h4>
              <p>Around a century later, Zeno of Elea advocated several paradoxes known as the paradoxes of motion. Each of them rests on another kind of infinity, the infinitesimal. fig.1 The Arrow Paradox describes a flying arrow fig.3 which, when viewed in the infinitely smallest fraction of space and time, is stationary. Another paradox of motion is fig.1 Achilles and the Tortoise. Fair-minded, fast-running Achilles grants the slow tortoise a head start, yet is never able to overtake the tortoise, because as he arrives at the tortoise’s previous point, the tortoise has advanced to a new point. There are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has been. Thus, Zeno concluded that fig.4 movement is an illusion. Unfortunately for Zeno, this has since been refuted.</p>

              <h4>Chapter 2. Vagueness</h4>
              <p>A mother gives birth to a perfectly functioning collection of cells. Once named, the name is virtually the only thing that remains constant until death. ‘We’ - our brains, thoughts, cells, appearances - experience the change in time. Our entire being is, at its end, nothing of what it was at its beginning. And each year that passes, we celebrate. But turning one year older doesn’t make us old, though each of us will eventually be old, no doubt. So what does the word ‘old’ mean? Like ‘old’ we can only understand most of our words when they are placed in relation to external meaning.We maneuver through the world with the help of man-made constructs, creating a system of measurements to compensate for something that our reality doesn’t provide us with: definitude. The absence of boundaries that we experience, we call vagueness.</p>

              <h4>Hair</h4>
              <p>Hair, a heap of commonplace relevance for most. fig.1 Thinking of losing too many strands makes everyone feel discomfort. Nevertheless, like the vagueness of Sorites, the process of losing hair prevents us from delineating between a full mane of hair and a bald head. Or let all the women in the world be lined up from fig.2 blond hair to black, short to long, and curly to straight. fig.3 One would certainly be hard-pressed to pinpoint where one quality begins and another ends. What happens to our concept of hairstyles then?</p>

              <h4>Organisms</h4>
              <p>Before evolution masterminded sex and death, life began in aquatic climes and could be seen as one collective entity proliferating through fig.1 asexual reproduction. As an unbroken process, it can still be observed today, even on creatures more complex than monads. fig.2 On the seabed, when a starfish loses all its arms and each arm grows new arms, is this still the same starfish, or its young? Or on land, break off a tree branch and plant it in the ground where it will continue to grow. fig.3 Is this a new tree?</p>

              <h4>Our World</h4>
              <p>Discussed in parallel is the question of whether vagueness simply arises from language or is a feature of our world itself. E.g. fig.1 Upon hiking up a mountain, one can see features of the valley left behind. And upon climbing down again, one sees the mountain looming up above. But to look back proudly on the path travelled, can we trace the beginning and end of each peak and trough? If we seek to find a valley line that separates two mountains, is the valley a string of atoms? A path wide enough for a pair of feet to walk through? It becomes absurd to debate the line between valley and mountain.</p>

              <h4>Chapter 3. Self-Reference</h4>
              <p>The Ouroboros is an image of a tail-consuming snake found documented in several cultures, and it serves as an ancient symbol of self-referential loopiness. Today, self-reference is still a stylistic mean in artistic and cultural production. Yet not all self-reference leads to paradoxicality - for instance, a movie about movies, or a piece of writing about authors’ self-referential qualities. Instead, what is of interest to philosophers is the kind of self-referentiality which circles around its own paradoxicality or traps one in an infinite loop, thus producing some of the deepest paradoxes. Take for example, the self-undermining statement, “This sentence is false”. Referring to itself, the sentence negates its own truth. Thus, if the meaning of the statement is true, then the statement itself is false. And if the meaning of the statement is false, then the statement is true. </p>

              <h4>When Pinocchio Lies</h4>
              <p>Another notorious liar that every truth-swearing finger-crossing kid knows about is Pinocchio, whose story is meant to warn them about the terrible consequences of lying. Yet this story of caution contains a paradox. How would his wooden body respond if Pinocchio said, “my nose is growing”? What would cause his nose to grow or not grow? Unlike the Cretans who got off scot-free , the contradiction caused by Pinocchio’s lying must result in physical confusion within his body as it is thrown into indecisiveness regarding the nose extension. </p>
